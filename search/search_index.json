An Internet application is a set of processes distributed across different computers and communicating among themselves.</p> <p>Processes in Internet applications may be categorized depending on whether they make services available to other processes, or they use services made available by other processes. In the former case the process is called a server, in the latter case the process is called a client. A server is usually used by many clients simultaneously. A client usually uses one or a few servers simultaneously. Many different interaction patterns between processes may exist, however.</p> <p>The above categorization is only for descriptive and introductory purposes. A process may act both as a server and as a client, either at the same time or at different times.</p> <p>A process communicates with another process by means of an abstraction called a connection.

In this course we are concerned only with the functionality (usage) of connections, not with their implementation.</p> <p>Each process in an Internet application has a globally unique identifier.</p> <p>A client process is usually structured as follows: 1. Determine the identifier of the server; 2. Open a connection to the server by specifying the server identifier; 3. Send requests into the connection and receive responses from that connection; 4. Close the connection. The client need not know its own identifier (but it may obtain this identifier by asking the operating system). Usually the client sends a request and does not send any further requests until receiving a response. Many different request-response patterns are possible, however.</p> <p>A server process is usually structured as follows: 1. Choose its own identifier; 2. Wait for connections open by clients; 3. For each open connection, receive requests from the connection and sends responses into that connection. The server need not know the client identifier (but it may obtain this identifier by asking the operating system). Steps 2 and 3 may be executed in parallel and step 3 may be executed in parallel for all connections currently open.</p> <p>Note the asymmetry of behavior: a client process specifies the identifier of the server with which it wants to connect; a server process accepts connections from any client process.</p> <p>Note that processes need not know how the above steps are implemented by the operating systems.

When the connection is no longer required it may be closed. * Connectionless: communication may occur at any time, without any need of creating a connection in advance.</p> <p>A communication service may appear to its users as: * Message-oriented: the service transports and delivers transmission units, i.e., messages. * Byte-oriented: the service has no notion of message. Any piece of information sent through the service becomes part of a unique byte stream that flows toward the other end. Application-level messages that are sent separately are thus merged together by the service.</p> <p>A communication service may appear to its users as: * Unreliable: information may be lost, delivered out-of-order, duplicated. * Reliable: information is not lost, is delivered in order and not duplicated.</p> <p>TCP is connection-oriented, byte-oriented and reliable. All the applications that we will study in this course use TCP. The software that implements those applications must thus handle connections, must be able to handle the conceptual mismatch between messages and byte stream and, most importantly, may assume a reliable service.</p> <p>IP is connectionless, message-oriented, unreliable. Since the implementation of TCP (not studied in this course) uses IP, it must be able to implement a reliable service over an unreliable service.</p> <p>Some applications use an upper layer that implements a protocol called UDP. The properties of UDP are the same as those of IP. Applications that use UDP, thus, must be prepared to handle duplicates, out-of-order delivery and losses.</p> <p>Note that time is never mentioned in the properties of communication services. The Internet does not provide any guarantee regarding the time it takes for information to reach its intended destination (or for concluding that it will never reach the destination).</p> <p>The definition of reliable service provided above is oversimplified. Obviously, if an atomic bomb explodes over a communication service while some information is travelling through that service, that information will never be delivered. A reliable service provides the properties listed above only when it exists; however, it may cease to exist at any time and applications will be eventually notified of this fact. These properties have subtle and important implications that will not be analyzed in this course. We only point out that when a process has sent a message and the operating system has returned a \u201csuccess\u201d, this fact does not imply that the message has been delivered or that will certainly be delivered. It only implies that the message has been copied from the process to the local operating system. A process can be certain that a message has been received by the other process only upon receiving an explicit response message by that process.</p>"},{"location":"1%20-%20Introduction/Appunti_Introduction/#process-identifiers-and-process-structuring","title":"Process identifiers and process structuring","text":"<p>A TCP process identifier is a pair of items called IP address and port number. * An IP address is a 32-bit globally unique host identifier assigned by a network administrator (this definition of an IP address will be refined later in the course). * A port number is a 16-bit identifier locally unique on the host where the process is executing and is assigned by the local operating system. IP addresses are represented in dotted decimal notation: the 32 bits are split into 4 bytes; each byte represents a natural number in the range [0,255]; the 4 numbers are concatenated and separated by a dot character (e.g. 131.114.9.252).

Concerning port numbers: * A server process chooses the port number before starting to wait for connections from clients and tells the operating system the chosen port number (if the port number is already in use by another process, then the operating system at the server will reject the choice). Internet standards define the server port number for each application protocol.

Some of these procedures are used by servers, some others by clients, some others by both servers and clients.

A domain name is a sequence of strings called labels and separated by the dot character (\u2018.\u2019).</p> <p>The infrastructure consists of thousands of servers distributed across the world that interact among themselves.

Common possibilities are:</p> <ol> <li>The local portion of the URL identifies the pathname of a file to be returned as a static document;</li> <li>The local portion of the URL identifies the pathname of an executable file to be run for constructing the dynamic document to be returned;</li> </ol> <p>The mapping between local portion of the URL and file pathname is server-specific.

Unless stated otherwise, in this course we will not consider statically defined entries.</p> <p>The above description of ARP is focussed on the mapping from IP addresses to Ethernet addresses, which is the only case of interest in this course. ARP allows more general forms of mapping and supports many different kinds of addresses.

In this case R sends the frame on that interface and addresses the frame to IP-d. * Route, otherwise.

An expression need not use all operands. When an operand is not part of a rule, the value of that operand is irrelevant for that rule.</p> <p>When the firewall has to handle a packet, the firewall: 1. Takes the IP addresses from the IP header and the port numbers from the TCP header (which is part of the IP payload); 2. Computes each rule; 3. If at least one rule is true, then the firewall allows the packet to proceed, otherwise it drops the packet.</p> <p>In principle, a firewall could have rules for inbound packets that are completely independent of those for outbound packets. In practice, for each rule that allows a certain kind of inbound packets there must be a rule allowing outbound packets of the same kind. Stated differently, there must be two rules for each kind of allowed TCP connection: one rule for inbound packets and another rule for outbound packets. If either of these rules is missing, then the corresponding TCP connection cannot even be open.</p> <p>The traffic to be allowed is often specified textually. A simple way for deriving the corresponding firewall rules is as follows: 1. Analyze the textual specification and list the kind of operations to be allowed. 2. For each kind of operation, list the required TCP connections. 3. For each TCP connection:  1. By using a diagram of the network architecture, try to place the two ends of the connection on the opposite sides with respect to the firewall.  2. If the connection can never cross the firewall, then this connection does not need any firewall rule.  3. Otherwise    1.

Per me \u00e8 molto complicato e faticoso, ve lo garantisco, ma in questo modo si dovrebbe riuscire a capire meglio il come ed il perch\u00e9. </p> <p>Ovviamente quando lo studente cerca di fare la corrispondenza tra quanto fatto a lezione e l'esperienza quotidiana mancano sempre alcuni elementi, pochi o molti ma mancano. A me sembra comunque il male minore, un buon compromesso tra tutti i vincoli e gli obbiettivi.</p> <p>E' importantissimo che lo studente si faccia sempre domande e cerchi sempre di mettere in corrispondenza quanto visto a lezione con l'esperienza quotidiana. Importantissimo. Occorre per\u00f2 essere consapevoli che la corrispondenza sar\u00e0 sempre parziale e non del tutto accurata, per i motivi discussi. Occorre inoltre evitare di cadere nell'approccio \"questo non lo capisco, quindi non sar\u00e0 importante o sar\u00e0 troppo complicato per me\"---in questo modo non si capisce nulla. Purtroppo a priori uno non sa se un aspetto sfugge perch\u00e9 \u00e8 giusto che sfugga oppure perch\u00e9 non lo si \u00e8 capito o non ci si \u00e8 riflettuto abbastanza. Studiare \u00e8 impegnativo, c'\u00e8 poco da fare.</p> <p>Ultima osservazione. In ogni argomento cerco di semplificare fornendo parte delle informazioni; quasi mai fornisco informazioni diverse dalla realt\u00e0.</p> <p>A volte mi capita di restringere troppo il sottoinsieme ed effettivamente manca qualcosa, in quel caso cerco di integrare. Questo problema per\u00f2 capita di rado, solo quando faccio modifiche significative al programma. In alcuni casi, pochissimi, invece di descrivere una parte della verit\u00e0 scelgo di descrivere una cosa leggermente diversa dalla verit\u00e0.</p> <p>In particolare, gli argomenti descritti in modo diverso dalla realt\u00e0 sono:</p> <ul> <li>DHCP</li> <li>Implementazione TLS</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/","title":"Argomenti","text":""},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#parte-1","title":"Parte 1","text":""},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#general","title":"General","text":"<p>Applicazioni e Protocolli (36) - Applicativi TCP (53) - Propriet\u00e0 Servizi Comunicazione (17)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#dns-uso","title":"Dns - USO","text":"<p>Premesse Generali (39) - Resource Records (38) - Creazione dominio (37)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#dns-impl-1","title":"Dns - IMPL 1","text":"<p>Implementazione DNS: Requisiti (12) - Implementazione DNS: Zone (32) - Risoluzione nomi: Domain tree navigation (46) - Errori gravi e frequenti (25)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#dns-impl-2","title":"Dns - IMPL 2","text":"<p>Implementazione DNS: Replicazione name server (27) - Creazione dominio (DNS Provider) (21)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#web-content","title":"Web - CONTENT","text":"<p>World Wide Web (33) - HTML in a nutshell (55) - Come fare un sito web (46) - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) e Javascript (56) - Pagina Web (16) - Documenti statici e dinamici (27)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#web-protocol","title":"Web - PROTOCOL","text":"<p>HTTP (47) - Proxy HTTP (14) - Invio dati al Web server (22)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#web-sessions","title":"Web - SESSIONS","text":"<p>Sessioni HTTP: Premessa (47) - Authentication (23) - FORM Authentication (45) - HTTP Basic Authentication (17) - Navigare in \"Incognito\" (11) - Analytics (34)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#email","title":"Email","text":"<p>E-mail: Funzionalit\u00e0 (28) - E-mail: Implementazione (78)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#parte-2","title":"Parte 2","text":""},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#network","title":"Network","text":"<p>Premesse Generali (16) - Implementazione Ethernet (39) - Throughput (16)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#ip-internetwork","title":"IP - Internetwork","text":"<p>Internetwork (64)</p>"},{"location":"Questo%20Corso/slide%20summary/#ip-netnum","title":"IP - Netnum","text":"<p>Indirizzi IP: qualche operazione \"a occhio\" (23) - Network number (37) - Host number (29) - Network di IP-dst (Finalmente...)
